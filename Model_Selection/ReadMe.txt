>> In order to analyze different models, run the lambda_Selection_3Layered.py file.
>> Different parameters (learning_rate, iterations, lamdas, polynomials) can be changed according to the user requirements.
>> More Layers can be added according to the requirements in Model_Selection_4LayeredNN.py.
>> To change regularization parameters (lamdas), head over to the "Regularization Parameter Selection" section and 
	change according to the requirements.
>> learning_rate and iterations can be changed in the section mentioned above.
>> To change the values that are used for string datatype (o,1,2,etc) in this project, head over to "String Data 
	Conversion to Int" in Data_Preprocessing.py file.
