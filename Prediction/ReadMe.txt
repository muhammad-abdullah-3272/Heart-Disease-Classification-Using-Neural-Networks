>> In order to implement prediction on model, run the Prediction.py file.
>> Sample features are given as demo. these can be changed, while this file can also be called externally for 
	predictions on complete data .
>> It is recommended to use the string features of dataset before calling prediction function as;
 	"F/M as 0/1", "ATA/NAP/ASY/TA as 0/1/2/3", "Normal/ST/LVH as 0/1/2", "N/Y as 0/1", "Up/Flat/Down as 0/1/2"
